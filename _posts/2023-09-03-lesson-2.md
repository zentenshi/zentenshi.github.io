## Sentence Pattern 1　
```
(これ・それ・あれ)は　(Noun)　です。
```
### Question Form 1
```
(これ・それ・あれ)は　何　ですか。
```
These are also known as demonstratives.[^fn1]

As mentioned in [Lesson 1]({% post_url 2023-09-03-lesson-1 %}):
* `か` is what denotes the question, do not rely on punctuation marks.
* When answering, you can say `はい` or `いいえ` or just omit it.

### Question Form 2
```
〇〇は　(Noun 1)　ですか、　(Noun 2)　ですか。
```
It's just a multiple choice question.

## Sentence Pattern 2
```
(Noun 1)の　(Noun 2)
```
Noun 2 is your main object and Noun 1 adds info about it. Usually tends to answer the questions
* What kind of ... is it? `何の`
* Who owns it? `誰の`
* Where is it from/made in? `どこの`

### Question Form
```
〇〇は　何の　(Noun)　ですか。
〜の　(Noun)　です。
```

If the question is about ownership, you can also answer like this
```
(Person)の　です。
```
For negatives, just replace `です`　with `じゃありません`

## Sentence Pattern 3
```
(この・その・あの)　(Noun)〜
```
Unlike SP 1, the noun is named/defined immediately after.

### Question Form
```
(この・その・あの)　(Noun)は　誰の　ですか。
(Person)の　です。
```
Question asks 'who', obviously a person is the answer.
