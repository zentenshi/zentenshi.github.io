## Everything before this line was written with ChatGPT.
As of writing this, I (X500658) am currently studying for the JLPT N4 exam which I'll be taking this December 2023. This site's main intention is to be an easily accessible resource containing everything in my learning materials. I don't want to read through the books I'm using when I'm just looking for one tiny thing, and I think my peers do too.

## Why does this exist?
This is just going to containg the basic stuff, grammar structure and special use cases and reading. *This is not meant to be used as a learning resource.* I will be making this in such a way that it is just meant to be used as a quick resource/review, just a quick peek.
