## Sentence Pattern 1 - Things
```
(Thing) (Number)つ　あります。
```
Refer to Special Readings page for the `つ` counter.[^fn1]

### Question Form
```
(Thing)が　いくつ　ありますか。
```

### Sentence Pattern Combination
Adding the `に` particle
```
(Place)に(Thing/s)が (Number)つ　あります。
```

## Other Counters
* 枚　- for flat/thin things
* 台　- for machines and vehicles
* 人　- for people (has special readings)[^fn2]
* 間　- for time/periods, prefaced with 時、日、週 or 年
Note that `pieces of bread` use `つ` but `slices of bread` uses `枚`.

### For 何人 Questions
Depending on which verb you use, the meaning changes
* です - `Includes` the speaker in the counting
* います - `Excludes` the speaker in the counting

### For Time Questions
Instead of asking 何(時・日・週・年)間, you can use `どのくらい` for an estimate of `How long`. Don't forget to use `かかります` when referring to **how long it `took/cost`**.
