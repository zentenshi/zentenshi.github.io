## Making the 辞書形
The grouping are exactly the same with the て形

### Group 1
Turn the I’s into U’s and remove `ます`. There are no special cases.

### Group 2
Simply remove `ます` and replace with `る`

Don't forget about the special cases[^fn1] here.

### Group 3

| ます形 | 形 |
| -- | -- |
| します | る |
| <ruby>来<rt>き</rt>ます<ruby> | <ruby>来<rt>く</rt>る</ruby> |

Note the special with 来る, it also applies with 持って来る

## Sentence Pattern 1 - Ability
```
(Verb，辞書形)ことが　できます。
```
Note that by adding `こと` to the verb's , the verb has become a noun. Therefore, you can also use `(Noun)が　∼`

### Question Form
```
(Interrogative)　(Verb,辞書形)ことが　できますか。
```
Don't forget that you can just use a regular noun here as well

## Sentence Pattern 2
```
趣味は　(Verb, 辞書形)です。
```
Don't forget that you can just use a regular noun here as well

## Sentence Pattern 3
```
(Verb 1, 辞書形)前に　(Verb 2, ます)
```
Don't forget that you can just use regular nouns here, as well as quantifiers. (Nounの)

Verb 2 takes place before Verb 1. Compare this to Lesson 16's SP4[^fn2] where Verb 1 must be done first.

When using a quantifier (period of time), don't forget that it's interrogative pair is `いつ`

## ぜひ　and なかなか

### ぜひ
`ぜひ` expresses hope (usually with a verb in たいform) or request (with the てください SP)

### なかなか - Not easily, not as expected
Don't forget that this is used with verbs in the negative form.
