## Sentence Pattern 1 - When
```
(Clause 1)時、(Clause 2, Verb in ます形)。
```

For Clause 1, you can have:
* Verb in 普通形
* Adjective (Don't forget the な when its a なAdj)
* Noun の

> When a time expression is used, don't forget that the verb's tense must also match it
{: .prompt-tip}

### Things to note
```
(Clause 1,Verb in た形)時、(Clause 2, Verb in ます形)。
```

When Clause 1 uses a verb in た形, it means that the action of clause 1 is done first. By the time the action of clause 2 is done, clause 1 is already completed.

## Sentence Pattern 2 - What will you do during ~
```
(Clause)の時　(何・どう)しますか。
```

When do you use these:

| 何 | There is NO problem/issue |
| どう | There IS A problem |

## Sentence Pattern 3
```
(Clause 1, verb in 辞書形)と　(Clause 2）
```
The SP implies that clause 2 happens with 100% certainty after clause 1 occurs

## Directions
TLDR `て、て、て・・・と、ます`

Spam (Verb in て形)[^fn1] until you reach the last action, use (Verb in 辞書形)と, finally (右・左)に　あります。

＃＃＃を
This new use of `を` is for `passing through`
