## Sentence Pattern 1 - ながら
```
(Verb 1, ます形)ながら　(Verb 2)
```
Verb 1 here is the circumstance while Verb 2 is the main action.

Note that for things that are done within a short period of time, Verb 2 just ends in ます, but if it is done over a long period of time, ています should be used instead. This indicates that Verb 2 has become a habit

## いつも vs たいてい

| いつも |　たいてい |
| -- | -- |
| always | mostly |
| 90% | ~70% |


## Sentence Pattern 2
```
 (Verb・Adj・Noun; all in 普通形)し・・・(Verb・Adj・Noun; all in 普通形)し・・・(Verb)
```
Used to list similar things of same polarity much like in Lesson 16, SP2[^fn1], but this SP doesn't modify whatever is being talked about. This SP is also used to say something with feelings and is only used in conversations.

You can also opt to add それに (on top of, furthermore) to the final verb.

Don't forget that when you have `が` in the clause you're using, you have to change it into `も`

## Sentence Pattern 3 - Multiple reasons
```
(Verb・Adj・Noun; all in 普通形)し・・・(Verb)
```
This still follows the rule of the previous SP.

Instead of the final `し`, you can replace it with `から` (because)
