## Sentence Pattern 1 - State + Intention/Purpose
```
(Optional; Place　に) (Noun)が　(Transitive Verb. て形) あります
```
Much like Lesson 29, SP2[^fn1], this SP is also used to express a continuing state. But this SP has the nuance of the action being intentionally done.

> This SP doesn't follow the basic rule of Transitive Verbs being paired with `を`.
{: .prompt-warning}

## Sentence Pattern 2
```
(Noun)は (Place)に　(Transitive Verb. て形) あります
```

## Sentence Pattern 3 - Preparation
```
(Certain time) (Transitive Verb. て形) おきます
```
This indicates the the Transitive verb **must** be completed by a certain time

Usually `(の)前に` is used to express the certain time.

## Sentence Pattern 4 - "For the next use"
```
(Transitive Verb. て形) おきます
```
Structurally same as SP3

## Sentence Pattern 5 - Keep the currect state as it is
```
(Reason)から　～　(Transitive Verb. て形) おきます
```

## Sentence Pattern 6 - Request version
This combines SPs 3-5 and Lesson 14, SP1[^fn2] to turn SP3 into a request
```
～　おいて　ください
```

## Thing to Note
Why does SP1 and SPs 3-5 use different particles?

| SP 1 | Nounが | Preparation is complete |
| SPs 3-5 | Nounを | Preparation is yet to be done |
