## Converting to すぎます
### Verbs - "Too much to do"
Replace `ます` with `すぎます`

Remember that this converts it to a Group 2 verb

### Adjectives - Too (adj)
Replace the `い` or `な` with `すぎます`

## Sentence Pattern 1 - Reason & result
```
～すぎて、(Verb,可能動詞)
```
Note that if the 1st clause has a `は`, it usually becomes `が`

## Sentence Pattern 2 - Easy/Hard to do
```
(Volitional verb, ます形）(やすい・にくい)です
```
Replace `ます` with the appropriate ending

## Sentence Pattern 3 - High/Low tendency, likelyhood of occurring

```
(Non-volitional verb, ます形）(やすい・にくい)です
```
Non-volitional verbs are usually intransitive

## Sentence Pattern 4 - To make the Noun be ...
```
(いAdj)く　します
(なAdj)に　します
(Noun)に　します
```
With adjectives, replace the `い` or `な` with `く` or `に`, respectively.

Unlike Lesson 19's SP3[^fn1] which is non-volitional, this SP is volitional.

## Sentence Pattern 5  - Choice, decision
```
(Noun)に　します
```
