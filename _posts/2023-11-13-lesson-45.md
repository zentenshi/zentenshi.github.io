## Sentence Pattern 1 - "In the event"
```
(Verb, 普通形) 場合は
(いAdj) 場合は
(なAdj)な 場合は
(Noun)の 場合は
```
This　SP is used for hypotheticals and is generally for bad things. Same usage as Lesson 23's SP1[^fn1]

## Sentence Pattern 2 - "Even though"
```
(Verb・いAdj, 普通形) のに
(なAdj)な のに
(Noun, 普通形)なのに
```
Note how the `だ` of the noun is converted to `な`

This SP is the inverse of ので, the result is not what is expected.
