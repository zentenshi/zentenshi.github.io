## The ところ SPs
These SPs await for the listener's reaction

## Sentence Pattern 1
```
(Verb, 辞書形) ところです
```
The speaker is just moments away from doing the verb. Using this SP can imply things like 一緒に(Verb)しませんか

Note:
* Do not use verbs that take a long time (ex. 育ちます)
* Do not use with momentary verbs (ex. 立ちます)

## Sentence Pattern 2
```
(Verb, て形)いる ところです
```
The speaker is in the process of doing the verb. Using this SP can imply things like ちょっと待ってください

Note:
* Much like SP1, do not use with momentary verbs (ex. 立ちます)
* Do not use non-volitional verbs

## Sentence Pattern 3
```
(Verb, た形) ところです
```
The speaker is just moments away from doing the verb. Usied this SP can imply things like どうしますか

## Sentence Pattern 4
```
(Verb, た形) ばかりです
```
The speaker feels that the verb just happened regardless of how much time has actually passed.

Note that ばかり is a noun, don't forget the な when using ので or のに

## Sentence Pattern 5
```
(Verb, 辞書形・ない形) はずです
(Adj) はずです
(Noun)の はずです
```
The speaker's natural/logical judgement based from evidence.　Much like でしょう、this implies 80-90% confidence
